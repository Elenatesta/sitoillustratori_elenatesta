        Camilo Huinca's work is rich with colour, content and a brightly illustrated narrative that speaks for itself. Born and raised in Santiago in Chile, Camilo has divided his career between graphic design and painting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Working independently has allowed Camilo to “develop (his) own style, having a main focus on the use of curiosity,” he explains. In 2014 Camilo set up Perfe Studio where he concentrates on graphic design projects in “a more commercial way”.
    </p>
    <p>    
        However, within illustration, he described his main motivation as, “to be able to generate a communication method based on simplicity and synthesis, with few tools and colours. I am interested in identifying people’s behaviour, portraying activities, intimate moments, body gestures, disfiguring objects and reducing the amount of detail in a composition.”
    </p>
    <p>    
        Camilo is fascinated by everyday scenes, moments and personal habits, often depicting scenic bus routes, art galleries and public figures in his own psychedelically shaped style. “Within my work I try to reproduce real moments from an innocent and impartial perspective.”
